## What's this

**Adbrowser** is a modern, cross-platform Android device file manager built
with [Jetpack Compose Multiplatform](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform).  
It allows developers and testers to access Android devices through ADB and visually browse and manage files on PC ‚Äî including debug app data without
root access.

The original intention of this project was that the Device File Explorer feature of Android Studio is not stable and reliable enough in some cases and
cannot run independently, and currently there is no complete cross-platform solution.

## Features

- üîå **ADB Integration**: Connect to authorized Android devices via ADB
- üóÇ **Full Filesystem Access**: Browse from root `/`, support for `/data/data` via `run-as` or `su`
- üíª **Cross-platform GUI**: Runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux using compose-multiplatform based on JavaFX
- üß≠ **Tabbed File Browsing**: Multi-tab design for easy navigation
- üß≤ **Drag and Drop Support**: Drag files in/out between device and PC
- üß† **Smart Access Layer**: Automatic privilege fallback ‚Äî root, `run-as`, or read-only
- üõ† **Designed for Developers**: Useful for debugging, testing, and inspecting app data

## Maintenance Status

This project is a **work in progress (WIP)** and under active development.
Judging from the developers' free time, the implementation may not be very fast.

The goal is to build a fast, reliable, and intuitive ADB-based file manager for Android devices.
